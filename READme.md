## **üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Using **pandas**, the dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency:
1. **Handling missing values**: Rows missing `Latest Funding Date`, `Latest Amount Raised`, and `Latest Round Share Class` were removed.
2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Removed the `%` from the `52 Wk Change %` column.
   - Extracted numeric values from `Price` (removed unnecessary details in brackets).
   - Standardized `Estimated Valuation`, `Total Funding Raised`, and `Latest Amount Raised` by converting values ending with `B` (billion) and `M` (million) to full numbers.
   - Converted `Price`, `Estimated Valuation`, `Total Funding Raised`, and `Latest Amount Raised` columns to numeric data type.
   - Converted `Latest Funding Date` column to date type.
3. **Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file** for further analysis.

The cleaning script is available in the [Markets Private Companies - Yahoo Finance](Markets-Private-Companies-Yahoo-Finance.ipynb) file
